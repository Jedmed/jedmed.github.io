    <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>A Game where two players compete to plant and harvest their crops with a watering feature that provides a strategic element</p>
    <h3>How it was built</h3>
    <p>Harvest Game is built primarily using jQuery. The game board is generated in Javascript and the weeds are randomly placed, hence every gameboard you play on will be different!</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>The water plant functionality in the game requires initiating an event over multiple targets. I was able to do this by finding the Index of the current target; generating an array with all targets relative to the Index of current target; then intiating the event on the array</p>
    <h3>Future Features</h3>
    <p>I would like to work on a Single Player version where the player would have to plant, water and harvest as many crops as they can before their field gets overridden with weeds that are being continuously being generated</p>
